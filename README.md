# SignatureSherlock
Handwritten Signature Forgery Detection System

Abstract:

A signature serves as a vital mark of identity and consent, especially crucial in situations vulnerable to forgery. It signifies agreement, acknowledges content, and holds individuals accountable. Though forgeable, a signature acts as a legal anchor, binding agreements, proving identity, and deterring fraud. Despite its vulnerability to forgery, a signature's significance remains. It signifies intent and binds individuals, making forgery a serious crime with potential legal and financial repercussions.
Signatures, vital for security, naturally vary in form due to individual inconsistencies. Our project will focus on offline signature verification, also known as static verification. Detecting forgeries amidst these variations requires advanced algorithms to discern genuine intent from malicious intent.

Despite the potential of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in offline signature verification, existing solutions often fall short, with accuracy consistently below 95%. This performance gap can be attributed to several factors. First, the quality and size of training data significantly impact the model's ability to generalize. Limited datasets may struggle to capture the full range of natural variations and complexities found in genuine signatures, leading to misidentifications. Second, forgeries are becoming increasingly sophisticated, with skilled individuals capable of mimicking genuine signatures very closely. This demands robust CNN architectures and meticulously crafted training strategies to effectively distinguish between authentic and forged signatures. Finally, achieving optimal performance requires careful fine-tuning of hyperparameters and exploration of diverse network architectures. Inappropriately chosen parameters can hinder the model's learning ability, limiting its accuracy.

I.	Introduction:

A signature is a unique mark, often incorporating elements of a person's name, that acts as a stamp of approval and confirmation of identity. It's like a personal fingerprint on documents, signifying that the signer accepts responsibility and validates the information contained within.

Beyond simply identifying the signer, a signature carries the weight of authority. It indicates that the person has the right and permission to take a specific action, making the document legally binding. Often, signatures serve as physical evidence of consent and understanding, demonstrating that the signer has reviewed and agreed to the contents of the document.

In essence, a signature is a powerful tool that goes beyond mere identification. It embodies the concepts of personal accountability, authorization, and verification, playing a crucial role in ensuring the legitimacy and validity of documents and actions.

Handwritten signatures have long been accepted as a form of verification and authentication in various contexts, from legal documents to financial transactions. However, their vulnerability to forgery poses a significant risk, making handwritten signature forgery detection essential for various reasons:
	1. To prevent fraud, and increase security during authorization.
	2. In Legal and financial protection, the authenticity of a signature can be crucial. These prevent misuse of authority for a lot of uses such as evidence, claims, or accusations.
	3. To increase confidence in documentation, if a signature is not verified, a person might avoid using that document. Verifying the signature and making sure it's not forged, provides a person with trust and confidence in that document.

 There can be 4 types of Signature forgery:

1. Freehand Forgery: This involves imitating an individual's signature without tracing or other aids. The forger attempts to replicate the general characteristics of the genuine signature, including letter strokes, pressure, and overall style.

2. Traced Forgery: As the name suggests, the forger places a genuine signature under a blank sheet of paper and then traces it to create a duplicate. This method can be quite accurate but may leave telltale signs like inconsistencies in pressure or pen          lifts.

3. Blind Forgery: Unlike the previous methods that attempt to replicate an existing signature, a blind forgery doesn't try to mimic any specific signature. The forger simply signs a name they believe resembles the genuine signature, often resulting in a less    convincing imitation.

4. Electronic Forgery: This type involves manipulating digital signatures on electronic documents. This can be done through various methods, such as altering scanned signatures or using sophisticated software to create convincing forgeries.

Handwritten signature forgery detection plays a vital role in safeguarding individuals and institutions from various security, financial, and legal risks associated with forged signatures. It ensures the integrity of transactions, agreements, and documents, promoting trust and confidence in systems that rely on this traditional verification method.

There are two types of Signature forgery detection, Offline and Online:
	Offline: This method focuses on analyzing the physical characteristics of a pre-written signature on a physical document, like paper or a scanned image. It primarily relies on visual and forensic techniques to identify inconsistencies that might point to forgery. Common features analyzed include:

  1. Shape and size: Examining the overall dimensions, proportions, and consistency of the signature form.
  2. Stroke characteristics: Analyzing pen pressure variations, stroke direction, individual letter formation, and potential tremor patterns.
  3. Static features: Observing elements like pen lifts, stops, and hesitations, although these are not always available in static analysis.

Online: This method involves analyzing the dynamic process of signing in real time using a specialized pen or tablet. These capture data points while a person signs, allowing the analysis of:

   1. Signing speed: Analyzing the speed at which the signature is written.
   2. Pen lifts and stops: Examining the number and timing of instances where the pen is lifted and stops during the signing.
	
We have designed Signature Sherlock to utilize Offline signature forgery detection, which is applied to scanned images of signatures. Then these images are compared to the saved real and forged scans of signatures. These comparisons are done based on a set of criteria that will be defined within the model, then using these comparisons our model will decide if the scanned signature is forged or not. If a signature is detected as forged, it will be flagged as forged and unusable. If the signature is real, then the model will flag it as real and will let the user know that it's safe to use that signature as a method of authentication.
